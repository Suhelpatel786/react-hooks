# React Project with TypeScript and React Router

This project is a basic React application created with TypeScript, using `react-router-dom` for navigation, and showcasing the usage of essential React hooks.

## Overview

Welcome to our React project! This repository contains a simple React application built to demonstrate the fundamentals of React hooks with TypeScript.

## Features

- **React Hooks Examples:** The project includes examples and use cases for the following React hooks:
  - `useState`: Managing component state.
  - `useEffect`: Handling side effects and data fetching.
  - `useMemo`: Memoizing computed values.
  - `useCallback`: Memoizing callback functions.
  - `useReducer`: Managing complex state logic.
  - `useContext` and `createContext`: Sharing state between components.

- **React Router for Navigation:** The application uses `react-router-dom` for client-side navigation, allowing users to navigate between different components.
